As promised in my last post [Vim Adventures (Part 1)](TODO: link) I'll follow up by presenting some basic techniques to manuever around vim and get yourself started with this awesome development environment.

But first, my previous article presented a few plugins that I use such as [CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) and the [Solarized Theme](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) so I thought I'd just leave a list of the rest of the plugins I use and a short description of them. So here it is:

1. [MatchTag](https://github.com/gregsexton/MatchTag) is a small plugin that highlights HTML matching tags. Comes in handy for any HTML developer.
2. [Emmet](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim). The bread and butter of any web developer. Greatly increases HTML writing efficiency, I highly recommend this one if you're not already using it. It's also available for other popular text editors such as *Sublime Text* or *Atom* if you prefer using that and you're just reading this for the lulz.
3. [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree). I find myself using this more and more seldom but it's still a great choice of a plugin especially when you're starting out with vim. It basically adds a sidebar to vim which is a fully-featured tree explorer.

That's about it as far as plugins are concerned, there's plenty more plugins out there which you can check out and improve your vim experience, I personally recommend [VimAwesome](http://vimawesome.com/) as a plugin explorer.

Onwards, minion!

When you first load it up you won't be able to do sh*t properly in it. Reading the few tips&tricks I've got for you in the following section will start to make things work, but it still won't be fast. At best, a week or two into using vim you'll be
